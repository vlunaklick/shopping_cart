> In this project I created a "Shopping Cart". It was created using React and I tried to implement the library react-router. On another hand, I changed all the CSS to styled-components so I can make a light/dark mode easier and could get more practice in that library. Also, I created my own hooks so it could be easier to reach those things and all the code isn't in one file.
